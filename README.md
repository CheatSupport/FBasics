## What is FBasics?

FBasics stands for "Factions Basics". The plugin provides you with an essential selection of features, designed for factions servers. It was initially developed to prevent all glitches / exploits that arised within my own factions server (OriginMC). Releasing this plugin is basically my little thank you to the community for helping me start out. Hopefully a few of you can benefit off this just as much as I have!
